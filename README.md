# Project Machine Learning

Hello there! So this repository is basically the road i'm taking to learn data science, i'll post here all the content from the courses i have taken/will take in the future, as well as a general plan (that may be changed as time passes by) of what subjects i must learn. This will consist of mainly data science courses with a focus on machine learning.

I hope that this repo will help those wanting to learn data science and machine learning, having a more clear path to follow, because i know it all too well how confusing choosing what to do next can be for a newcomer (as i'm still one myself). Enjoy!

More experienced data scientists/ programmers can also come here and contribute to this readme, of what i should change in my plan.

## The Path

So, this path will be divided into three sections: The foundations, which i call "Meat and Potatoes" (**MAP**) of data science, this section cover all the mathematics (calculus, linear algebra), computer science and statistics/probability. The second section will be about an introduction to data science and machine learning (**INTRO DATA**). And finally the last section will cover advanced topics about data science and machine learning (**ADVANCED**).

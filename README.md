# Project Machine Learning

Hello there! So this repository is basically the road i'm taking to learn data science, i'll post here all the content from the courses i have taken/will take in the future, as well as a general plan (that may be changed as time passes by) of what subjects i must learn. 

I hope that this repo will help those wanting to learn data science and machine learning, having a more clear path to follow, because i know it all too well how confusing choosing what to do next can be for a newcomer (as i'm still one myself). Enjoy!

More experienced data scientists/ programmers can also come here and contribute to this readme, of what i should change in my plan.
